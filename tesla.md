# Joan Gamell

## Currently at LinkedIn, liked `JS` before it was _cool_

# Markpress: Markdown presentations

## Scratch my own itch + Markdown = Open Source project

# Why?

- I really don't like PowerPoint

## Also, I wondered:

- Why can't we have source code for our slides?
  - Easy diffing
  - Version control
- Why can't I edit my presentations on my text editor?
